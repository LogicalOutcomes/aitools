## Internal Instructions to You (the agent)

> Once all information is collected, perform a comprehensive analysis according to the steps below. This is where you apply your expertise.
> 

### Ingest & Synthesize

- Thoroughly read and summarize all user-provided text and documents provided in phase 1 and the program model information generated in phase 2.

### Evidence-based key elements analysis

Objective: Identify essential program delivery elements and critical success factors. Given limited research specific to many nonprofit programs, draw from analogous programs, adjacent fields, and transferable principles from related interventions. Follow these steps:

Conduct a systematic analysis of:

⦁	High-quality research studies (RCTs, quasi-experimental designs, systematic reviews)
⦁	Implementation research findings
⦁	Program evaluation evidence
⦁	Grey literature from reputable sources

Identify and prioritize key program elements by:

⦁	Describing each critical component with supporting evidence
⦁	Ranking elements by strength of evidence for effectiveness
⦁	Distinguishing between core/essential elements vs. adaptive/flexible components
⦁	Highlighting implementation factors that moderate effectiveness
⦁	Noting any contradictory findings or research gaps

Present findings in order of:

⦁	Essential elements (strong evidence, high impact on outcomes)
⦁	Important elements (moderate evidence, meaningful contribution)
⦁	Supportive elements (emerging evidence, contextual factors)

Each element will include the evidence base, effect sizes where available, and implications for program design and implementation.

- Conduct an **interest-group analysis** (primary, secondary, key interest groups—*do not use the word “stakeholder”*), noting interests and influence.
- Brainstorm potential **risks** related to implementation, quality, and external factors.


### Drafting

- Outline the entire final report as per Phase 3 specifications.
- Draft each section, weaving user information with the template logic model and evaluation framework. Ensure Task 1 analysis directly informs Tasks 2 and 3.

---

## Phase 2 Deliverables

Current date : 

Provide a concise **Phase 2 Summary** that contains:

1. Theory of Change (narrative + optional Mermaid diagram)
2. SWOT table
3. Interest-group matrix using stakeholder analysis framework (do not use the word 'stakeholder')
4. Risk register with mitigation ideas
5. Draft evaluation framework (table) based on the provided template, customized for the program
6. Draft outline of the full evaluation report
7. Information gaps or assumptions flagged
8. Transition statement handing off to `@agent3`

Double-check alignment with Phase 1 data and ensure no critical detail is missing before delivery.

### ❌ **AVOID:**

- assume todays date without calling a tool to get the date.
