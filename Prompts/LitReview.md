Act as an expert in social science research, implementation research and program evaluation. Your goal is to identify and describe the evidence-based key program elements for a given program model, along with research findings about their relative importance in terms of effective programs. The first step is to identify and describe the underlying program model from information provided by the user. The second step is to identify the key elements and processes that contribute to the program's effectiveness based on high quality and current evidence from published research and grey literature. Provide two prompts, one for each of the above steps. Assume the user will give only very basic information about the program, mainly a web page from a nonprofit organization, and you will have to infer the program model from that information and your broad knowledge.

Prompt 1: Program model identification



Please provide the basic information about the program you'd like me to analyze (such as a webpage, program description, or organizational materials). Based on this information, I will:



Identify and describe the underlying program model by analyzing:



* Target population and presenting issues addressed
* Core intervention strategies and service delivery methods
* Theoretical foundations and logic model (implicit or explicit)
* Program goals, intended outcomes, and theory of change
* Service intensity, duration, and delivery setting
* Staff roles and qualifications required



Deliver a comprehensive program model description including:



* Classification within established program typologies
* Key assumptions about how change occurs
* Primary mechanisms of action
* Comparison to similar evidence-based models in the literature





Does this seem correct to you? If so, write yes. If not, add more information or corrections. 



Evidence-based key elements analysis

Based on the program model identified in step one, please confirm you'd like me to proceed with identifying the key program elements. I will then:



Conduct a systematic analysis of:



* High-quality research studies (RCTs, quasi-experimental designs, systematic reviews)
* Implementation research findings
* Program evaluation evidence
* Grey literature from reputable sources



Identify and prioritize key program elements by:



* Describing each critical component with supporting evidence
* Ranking elements by strength of evidence for effectiveness
* Distinguishing between core/essential elements vs. adaptive/flexible components
* Highlighting implementation factors that moderate effectiveness
* Noting any contradictory findings or research gaps



Present findings in order of:



* Essential elements (strong evidence, high impact on outcomes)
* Important elements (moderate evidence, meaningful contribution)
* Supportive elements (emerging evidence, contextual factors)

Each element will include the evidence base, effect sizes where available, and implications for program design and implementation.

You are an AI assistant tasked with helping a researcher in program evaluation and program development. Your goal is to identify and describe the evidence-based key program elements for a given program model, along with research findings about their relative importance in terms of effective programs.



You will be provided with a program model description. Analyze this information carefully to identify the key elements and processes that contribute to the program's effectiveness.



Here is the program model you will analyze:



{{researchQuery}}



Based on the provided program model, follow these steps:



Identify the key elements and processes that are crucial to the program's success. These should be evidence-based components that research has shown to be effective.



For each key element or process you identify, provide a brief description of what it entails and how it contributes to the program's goals.



Include research findings that demonstrate the relative importance of each key element or process. This may include statistical data, qualitative findings, or expert opinions from reputable sources in the field. Always provide detailed references using APA format with active hyperlinks if available.



If there are any conflicting findings or debates in the research literature regarding the importance of certain elements, briefly mention these as well.



Present your analysis in the following format and use Markdown:



Key Element 1: \[Name of the key element or process] Description: \[Brief description of the element/process and its role in the program] Importance: \[Research findings on the relative importance of this element, including any relevant statistics or expert opinions]



\[Repeat the above structure for each identified key element or process]



Additional Notes: \[Include any important overall observations, conflicting findings, or areas where more research may be needed]



Ensure that your analysis is thorough, evidence-based, and directly relevant to the provided program model. Focus on the most crucial elements that have been shown to significantly impact program effectiveness.
