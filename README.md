## Generative AI tools for nonprofits - in development

This repository contains documentation and workflows for MindStudio AI apps developed by [LogicalOutcomes, a Canadian nonprofit](https://www.logicaloutcomes.net/resources/). 

MindStudio is an no-code application that creates AI tools using your choice of dozens of Large Language Models. See https://learn.mindstudio.ai/ for a video tutorial. 

To copy these into your own workspace, create a MindStudio account and generate a new blank app. Then copy the entire contents of the JSON text file that you want and paste it into a new workflow. See [this video](https://www.loom.com/share/c23d37eaf9624cf6b0dd4b8c1a33220a). 

If you are using a free account, you will be restricted to the cheapest Large Language Models.
