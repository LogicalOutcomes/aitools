Generative AI tools for nonprofits - in development

This repository contains documentation and workflows for MindStudio AI apps. 

To copy these into your own workspace, create a MindStudio account and generate a new blank app. Then copy the entire contents of the JSON text file that you want and paste it into a new workflow. 

If you are using a free account, you will be restricted to the cheapest Large Language Models.
